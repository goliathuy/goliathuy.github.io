# Mario Albornoz - Developer Hub & Project Showcase

This project contains my professional information and the Kegel Exercise Timer application, packaged as a GitHub Pages site.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Developer Hub page with my professional background and project links
- `kegel-timer.html`: The standalone Kegel exercise timer application
- `styles.css`: Shared CSS styling for both pages
- `hub.js`: JavaScript for the Developer Hub page functionality
- `script.js`: JavaScript for the Kegel timer application functionality
- `manifest.json`: PWA manifest file
- `sw.js`: Service worker for offline capabilities
- `icons/`: Directory containing icon files for the application

## Developer Hub Section

The Developer Hub section features:
- Professional introduction and background
- Experience timeline
- Skills showcase
- Link to the Kegel timer application

## Kegel Timer Application

The Kegel Exercise Timer application features:
- Visual timer with hold and relax phases
- Multiple pre-defined exercise routines
- Customizable exercise settings
- Progress tracking
- Educational content about Kegel exercises

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the Developer Hub.
3. Access the Kegel Timer application by clicking the "Kegel Timer App" button or directly opening `kegel-timer.html`.

## Purpose

- **Professional Information**: The index.html serves as an introduction to my background and skills.
- **Kegel Exercise Timer**: The kegel-timer.html provides a tool for guided Kegel exercises.
- **AI Code Generation Exploration**: This project demonstrates creating and modifying web content using AI assistance with minimal direct code manipulation.

## Development

The project is structured to allow independent work on both the Developer Hub and the Kegel timer application. You can modify the timer application without affecting the Developer Hub and vice versa.

## Future Developments

- **Save Progress and History**: Add the ability to save progress and history to a local file and upload it again.
- **Expanded Project Collection**: Add more projects and detailed experience sections.
